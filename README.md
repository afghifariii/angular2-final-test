# Angular2FinalTest

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0-rc.2.

## Development server

* I use 3 Component wich separate into 3 folders inside src/app/ (to-do, to-do-form, to-do-list)
* 1 Custom directive (hover.directive) in src/app/
* 1 Custom pipes (priority-list.pipe) in src/app/to-do-list/
* 1 Service (to-do-list.service) in src/app/to-do-list/
* 1 mock-xhr-backend in src/app/
* 1 provider (lookupLists and lookupListToken for priority) in src/app/to-do-list/
* 1 built-in validator.


*Since i use mock-xhr-backend it will reload the list after u add a new list, u have to delete 1 to see the updated list*
